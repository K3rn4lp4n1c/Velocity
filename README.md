# Velocity
We use vehicles (especially cars) to implement object-oriented paradigms, data structures and algorithms. We don't know how far this project will go but for now we will focus on the object-oriented part of the program to build vehicles as objects and use functions to "operate" them. Later on, we'll bring in maps, races, garages and other features.
